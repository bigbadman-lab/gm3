# GM3 — Real-Time Token Discovery & Alerts

GM3 is a real-time Solana token discovery and alerting engine designed to surface **high-signal tokens early** — before they become obvious.

GM3 powers:
- a web dashboard,
- an iOS app,
- and a terminal / CLI experience,

all backed by the same real-time data engine.

---

## What GM3 Does

GM3 continuously analyzes on-chain activity to:
- detect early momentum,
- filter out low-quality or manipulated tokens,
- and surface tokens that meet strict quality and efficiency criteria.

The goal is not “what’s loudest”, but **what’s worth paying attention to**.

---

## How GM3 Works (High Level)

GM3 runs a live pipeline with four stages:

### 1. Discovery
GM3 monitors on-chain activity in short rolling windows and identifies tokens with unusual, sustained activity.

### 2. Qualification
Discovered tokens must pass multiple checks, including:
- real participation (not just bots),
- strong buy pressure,
- meaningful capital inflow,
- and sufficient liquidity.

Only tokens that meet these criteria are considered **qualified**.

### 3. Alerting
Qualified tokens are further evaluated for:
- capital efficiency,
- healthy market structure,
- and sustainable inflow patterns.

Tokens that pass are marked **alertworthy** and prioritized across GM3 surfaces.

### 4. Tracking
Alertworthy tokens are tracked in real time:
- current valuation
- all-time highs
- momentum over time

## What Makes GM3 Different

### Signal > Noise
GM3 does not rank tokens purely by volume or hype.  
Every surfaced token has passed deterministic, explainable checks.

### Early, Not Late
GM3 is designed to detect *emerging* activity — not tokens that already peaked.

### Explainable by Design
There is no black-box scoring.  
Signals are derived from observable on-chain behavior and capital flow.

### Real-Time Infrastructure
The same real-time backend powers:
- the website,
- the iOS app,
- and the CLI.

## Free vs Pro Access

### Free
- Delayed data
- Curated selection of qualified tokens
- Limited refresh rate

### Pro
- Real-time data
- Early alerts on high-signal tokens
- Full access across web, iOS, and CLI
- Faster refresh and deeper tracking

Upgrading to Pro unlocks **speed and completeness**, not just more data.

## Supported Platforms

- 🌐 Web dashboard
- 📱 iOS app
- 💻 Terminal / CLI

Your account works seamlessly across all platforms.

---

## Built for Reliability

GM3 is engineered with:
- deterministic logic (no guesswork),
- idempotent updates,
- strict lifecycle rules,
- and automatic archiving.

Historical data is never rewritten, and signals are never retroactively altered.

---

## Vision

GM3 exists to answer one question:

> **“What is starting to matter — and why?”**

Not later.  
Not after everyone sees it.  
Early, explainable, and actionable.

---

GM3 is under active development.  
New signals, alerts, and Pro features are added continuously.
